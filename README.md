# Figures in Salsa Cubana 
A small collection of figures we learned in Salsa schools around Zurich. The figures are mentioned by the name the particular school is using, and most often described as part of a Rueda sequence. I also tried to mention the timing whenever possible.   Unfortunately the descriptions are not very self explanatory and may not of any use to people who haven’t taken classes in these schools.

**Disclaimer:** The wording may be wrong, the spelling too as well as the timing. I'm neither an expert in Spanish nor in Salsa Cubana.
